## Undergraduate Teaching

### BI3010: Statistical Analysis of Biological Data

This course introduces students to key statistical concepts and data analysis techniques in biological sciences. It makes strong use of R and `ggplot2` but aims to give a strong theoretical understanding of statistical modelling and associated topics.

#### Modules:
- Why do we need statistics?  
- Introduction to linear models (LM) and hidden assumptions  
- The theory of effective data visualisation  
- R and `ggplot2`  
- LMs with a continuous predictor  
- Interpreting LMs with a continuous predictor  
- Assessing assumptions of LMs with a continuous predictor  
- LMs with a categorical predictor  
- Interpreting LMs with a categorical predictor  
- Assessing assumptions of LMs with a categorical predictor  
- LMs with multiple predictors  
- Confounding and causality  
- Null Hypothesis Significance Testing and P-values  
- An Information Criterion (AIC)  
- An introduction to GLMs  
- Poisson GLMs

## Postgraduate Teaching

### PGR Course: Generalised Linear Models (GLMs)

This advanced course focuses on the theory and application of Generalised Linear Models, tailored for postgraduate researchers. The course is tailored to be non-field specific meaning it can be taken by geologists to marketers and any in between.

It emphasises:

- Understanding the underlying statistical theory
- Parameter estimation
- Model fitting
- Connecting models to the underlying equations

#### Modules:
- Introduction to statistical modelling and GLMs  
- Poisson GLMs  
- Binomial GLMs  
- Bernoulli GLMs
