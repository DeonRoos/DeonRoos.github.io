    "text": "Universities across the UK are in a pretty precarious position right now. After a host of issues, post 2020 has seen the number of students fall. The well seems to be drying up.\nAnd in some cases dramatically. Coventry University made a £54 million loss in 2023-24. Dundee was talking about having to fire ca. 600 employees because apparently the previous senior management team weren’t too good at maths.\nNow, possibly in combination with inflation and the “cost-of-living-crisis”, the long term viability of some universities is looking… Grim.\nThis got me thinking over the weekend as to why. What’s going on with high-school students that makes it less attractive to go to uni? I don’t know and I can’t answer this. I’d need to do a survey of school kids and universities would never pay to get evidence to make a decision. There’s no money remember? Unless it’s for an external consultancy team to tell you if you were fire red or earth green.\nWhat I can do is look at some larger scale patterns with some crude data. It’s something, I guess. I think most people would point to faltering university recruitment and see a clear line between Brexit (and latterly, the Tories not being the most welcoming to foreigners) and the loss of the pool of European applicants.\nBut if that’s the case, then we shouldn’t see any similar kinds of trends in UK students applying to UK universities, right? Their numbers should be relatively stable. If you’re in Englandshire, why would you care that you can’t go to Europe if you were planning to go to Englandshire University regardless?\nSo that’s the idea and my question. Is there something a bit more gloabl going on than just little Britain? If UK students are relatively stable, while EU applicants fall, then it’s probably mostly because of Brexit (and associated policies) that uni recruitment is falling. And strategies to target non-EU international students may well work. But if not? Well, that’s the more “global thing”, right?\n\n\nI’ll be skipping the data processing and going straight into the analysis. As such, I will only be using a few packages:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\n# DT is just for including data in the blog\nlibrary(DT)\n\n\nTo look into this I pulled some data off of the UCAS website. The UCAS site is a bit of a nightmare to navigate and an even bigger cluster fuck to figure out which of the seemingly gajillions of .csvs they’ve thrown into a zip file contain relevant information I want.\nRest assured, I have been through the valley of cluster fuckery and have emerged with a dataset. I won’t subject you to the Olympic levels of gymnastics I went through to get this but if you want a visual summary, watch The Book of Eli.\nHere’s the data.

    "section": "What is a Structural Topic Model?",
    "text": "What is a Structural Topic Model?\nA Structural Topic Model (STM) is a type of analysis that allows us to explore large sets of text documents and identify what the common themes are; called topics. Just like you did in BI3010, you can also include covariates (also called explanatory variables) to say why you think a topic may be more or less prevalent over time.\n\nGrace, in your case, this might include things like how date (i.e. how has coverage of lynx changed over time), and if the illegal release of lynx (and maybe their interaction) may have changed which topics are more or less prevelant. For example, did negative topics become more common in the media after the illegal release compared to before?\n\nSTMs are a fairly complex beast. There are lots of elements that we could cover. One that I won’t touch on much here is Bayesian statistics. I have written another set of documents that explain the general theory of this, which you are welcome to see. Although STMs, as implemented in the R package stm, use the Bayesian statistical framework, you can’t actually interact with it, so it’s not crucial to understand in this case. However, I would recommend trying to wrap your head around it, as it’s a piece of knowledge that may make you highly employable.\nStructural Topic Models make the following key assumptions:\n\nEach document (e.g., a newspaper article) is a mixture of topics, with each topic contributing to the document in a proportion.\nExample: A particular article might be 90% about “lynx are good” and 5% about “lynx are bad”\nEach word in the document is associated with one of these topics.\nExample: If a word belongs to the topic “lynx are bad”, it is more likely to be something like “kill”, “predator”, or “livestock”. The probabilty for topic-specific word contribute to create an entire distribution of probabilities for all words used in a topic. Collectively, topic-words are referred to as content.\n\nThus, each topic has a characteristic distribution over words, e.g., topic 3 might have a 30% chance of using “kill”, 25% chance of “livestock”, and only 0.5% for “natural”.\nSo our objective then, is to identify different topics, and which words tend to categorise those topics. This is what we’re, fundamentally, trying to do in an STM."

    "text": "But how do they work?\nMechanically, an STM works as follows:\n\nFor each document \\(d\\), estimate the latent topic prevalences (latent just means something we cannot observe, i.e. there’s no label on a newspaper article that says “This is Pro-Lynx”, we have to estimate that from data). We do this by using a \\(logistic\\) \\(normal\\) distribution, whose mean is determined by document-level covariates (basically through a GLM).\nConvert these latent prevalences into a topic proportion vector \\(\\theta_d\\) via a softmax transformation (i.e., normalizing onto the simplex).\nFor each word \\(w_{d,n}\\) in the document:\n\nEstimate which topic to assign it to using \\(z_{d,n} \\sim \\text{Categorical}(\\theta_d)\\) (another GLM)\nThen, given the topic \\(z_{d,n}\\), estimate the word from that topic’s word distribution \\(\\beta{z_{d,n}}\\)\n\n\nThat’s only 5 bullet points and it made my head spin multiple times the first time I read it.

That's the flaw that we suffer from,\" Musharraf said at a news conference, noting that more evidence was emerging about the attack. \"We needed more experience, maybe more forensic and technical experience that our people don't have. Therefore I thought Scotland Yard may be more helpful.\" Musharraf said he also reached out to British investigators for assistance to dispel accusations that Pakistan's military or intelligence services were involved. \"We don't mind going to any extent, as nobody is involved from the government or agency side,\" he said. Speaking a week after Bhutto's assassination in a shooting and suicide bombing, Musharraf denied there had been a security lapse and implied that Bhutto, who was greeting supporters through the sunroof of her armored vehicle at the time of the attack, was partly responsible. \"Who is to be blamed for her coming out (of) her vehicle?\" he asked, adding that others in the vehicle had not been hurt in the attack.When in doubt, blame the victim.Reports in the immediate aftermath of the bombing said that as far back as November, Bhutto believed Musharraf was deliberately withholding security forces that could have made her safer. Unless he feared Bhutto more than the street riotors, I doubt whether that was really true. More likely, he didn't trust the army to protect her. And when she requested that Musharraf allow her to use western private security firms, he refused.I don't think Musharraf wanted Bhutto dead. But I think he is just too weak and indecisive to have done what was needed to protect her.\n2 I honestly don't know how either party's caucus results will play out tonight. Usually, you can get a good idea of perhaps not a winner but at least you can figure out who's up, who's down, and who's on life support.Not with the Iowa Caucuses. Races in both parties are just too close to call. So many variables. So much volatility among the voters. And the polls are whacky.As an example, here are the final two polls out on Iowa. First, ARG:Mike Huckabee 29% (23%) Mitt Romney 24% (32%) Fred Thompson 13% (7%) John McCain 11% (11%) Rudy Giuliani 8% (6%) Ron Paul 6% (6%) Duncan Hunter 4% (2%) Undecided 4% (11%) (Number in parentheses is from ARG survey taken last week)The spread between Huckabee and Romney is the margin of error which means they are virtually tied. Note Thompson's huge bump. Is he surging? Many think so although he probably doesn't have enough juice to catch either front runner for second place. But a strong third sends him along the campaign trail - despite what you might have heard about him dropping out. (Fred and his staff are denying the filthy rumor every chance they get.)Meanwhile, Zogby's daily tracking poll (three day rolling average) tells a little different story:* Huckabee - 31%* Romney - 25%* Thompson - 11%*McCain -10%Here the Huckster opens up a slight lead on Romney with Thompson and McCain far back in the pack.On the Democratic side, Obama has sprinted into the lead:Democrat Barack Obama continued his upward momentum through the evening before the Iowa caucuses, capturing the lead ahead of rivals John Edwards and Hillary Clinton.. Meanwhile, Republican Mike Hucakbee widened his lead over Mitt Romney down the stretch, the newest and last Reuters/C–SPAN/Zogby daily telephone tracking poll in Iowa shows. Obama broke through the 30% barrier for the first time, gaining 31% support after another strong day leading up to the caucuses. But more dramatic was Clinton’s four-point drop in this last day of tracking. Edwards moved into second place by himself after another day where he steadily gained ground. This fifth and final daily tracking poll was conducted using live telephone operators in the Zogby call center in Upstate New York. Edwards finished this Zogby daily tracking in Iowa in the same place as four years ago, when Zogby correctly identified the finishing order of the candidates in that caucus.Hillary Clinton has been playing down her chances the last 48 hours and could very well finish 3rd.All of this matters little in the end. The process of caucusing is complicated for the Democrats and it is possible for any of the top three candidates to win or come in third.We'll see by midnight tonight central time.\n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          While we stand in awe of the willingness of our troops in Iraq to sacrifice themselves for the Nation, the fewer that are required to do so, the better.  And the news on that front is good.  As can be seen in the chart below, our military deaths in December dropped to 23 from 37 in November.  December deaths are down over 80% (82%) from May's peak this year of 126.  Assuming this reflects a permanent change in the correlation of forces in Iraq - and it is likely that it does, although we cannot be certain of it - it reflects a tremendous achievement on the part of General Petraeus, since this is the result not of retreating from our objectives in Iraq but of advancing toward them - of executing the mission.What of Iraqi deaths?  Iraqi security forces and civilian fatalities are also down in December from November. Iraqi deaths are down only by a small amount - from 560 in November to 534 in December, although that difference is not small if you are one of the ones who are now still alive.  And the decline from this year's peak in February of 3,014 is a drop of 82%(!).Are we out of the woods in Iraq?  It would seem not.  We have General Odierno's estremely disturbing cri de coeur  at the end of November, which we can assume was endorsed by his chief, General Petraeus.  So far as we know, General Odierno's point \"A window of opportunity has opened for the government to reach out to its former foes, said Army Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the commander of day-to-day U.S. military operations in Iraq, but ‘it's unclear how long that window is going to be open.'\"has not been resolved.  While some economic indicators, such as the Iraq Stock Exchange and the value of the Iraqi dinar, are showing real strength, the status of the estimated 4 million internal and external refugees remains open, as does the high unemployment rate, estimated at over 40%.  But the fatalities figures are good news on the war-fighting front and we don't want to miss them.  Success doesn't always announce itself.   It's important not to miss it when it is achieved.\n4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                These pages recently said goodbye to global warming.  Ironically, the current spell of global warming, such as it is, can be expected to end just as the Kyoto treaty ends in 2012, but having nothing to do with reduced emissions from fossil fuels.  For the remainder of this century, it will be global cooling we'll have to worry about, according to highly credentialed Russian scientist, Dr. Oleg Sorokhtin.Dr. Sorokhtin, Merited Scientist of Russia and fellow of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, is staff researcher of the Oceanology Institute.  He explains the recent warming as a natural trend.\"Earth is now at the peak of one of its passing warm spells. It started in the 17th century when there was no industrial influence on the climate to speak of and no such thing as the hothouse effect. The current warming is evidently a natural process and utterly independent of hothouse gases.\"So what will happen in the future?\"Astrophysics knows two solar activity cycles, of 11 and 200 years. Both are caused by changes in the radius and area of the irradiating solar surface. The latest data, obtained by Habibullah Abdusamatov, head of the Pulkovo Observatory space research laboratory, say that Earth has passed the peak of its warmer period, and a fairly cold spell will set in quite soon, by 2012. Real cold will come when solar activity reaches its minimum, by 2041, and will last for 50-60 years or even longer.\"Physical and mathematical calculations predict a new Ice Age. It will come in 100,000 years, at the earliest, and will be much worse than the previous. Europe will be ice-bound, with glaciers reaching south of Moscow.\"The high standing of Dr. Sorkhtin and the inherent plausibility of his argument that climate will continue to follow the same basic causal factor, solar activity, make this another heavy blow to the heavy breathing of the global warming alarmists, who insist there is no argument at all.\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       A US report shows how the enemy controlled the information on the battlefield in Fallujah and used this to force the US and Iraqi forces out, in the first battle there. The Belmont Club points out UPI coverage of the report by Shaun Waterman. Here is how the enemy worked: First they kidnapped reporters from major Western news sources, driving them out of the city, and leaving only Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and local stringers controlled by the enemy as the sole sources of news. When the US returned with many embedded journalists and cut the enemy's information monopoly we won.These figures demonstrate how the insurgency purposely drove the press from the field to recreate the information monopoly they found so advantageous in the opening days of the First Fallujah, when only journalists from Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya were reporting from the scene. The kidnapping campaign compelled news outlets to rely on stringers who could then be controlled by the insurgency and who could be counted on to miraculously stumble on photo opportunities showing insurgents in action, such as the Pulitzer Prize winning photograph of an Iraqi election worker being killed on Haifa Street. The effective riposte again turned out to be finding ways to break the reportorial stranglehold the enemy had established. The information blockade runners turned out to be bloggers and journalists embedded in the military, of whom Michael Yon is perhaps the most famous. The Iraqi bloggers were protected by their anonymity and the embedded journalists were protected by coalition troops. These reporters outflanked the wall of \"access journalism\" which was gradually restricting the majors and created alternative sources of reportage. Although few in number these blockade runners played a pivotal role in penetrating the \"bodyguard of lies\" with which al-Qaeda and the Sunni insurgency had surrounded itself.\n           docname       rating day blog\n1 at0800300_1.text Conservative   3   at\n2 at0800300_2.text Conservative   3   at\n3 at0800300_3.text Conservative   3   at\n4 at0800300_4.text Conservative   3   at\n5 at0800300_5.text Conservative   3   at"

badly in last week which means that it is likely neither he or Hillary Clinton will come out of Super Tuesday with a large lead in delegates.According to published polls and analysts in the know, Obama has an edge in Idaho, Colorado, Minnesota, Kansas, Alabama, Georgia, North Dakota and Illinois while Hillary Clinton is ahead in New York, New Jersey, Tennessee, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas.Up for grabs are  California, Connecticut, Democrats Abroad, Arizona, Missouri, Delaware, Utah, American Samoa, Alaska, Massachusetts. Of those states, Hillary is ahead in Massachusetts with Obama closing while Obama has surged ahead in California but not by much. Clinton is also ahead in Connecticut and Missouri but by less than 5 points.Obama has been surging in the national polls as well, drawing within the margin of era in most of the daily tracking polls. This could mean that a few of those toss up states may end up going to Obama.As far as delegate totals, most anaylsts expect only a 50-75 delegate edge to either candidate come Wednesday morning. And this could mean - probably means - that the Democratic race will be decided by Superdelegates; those 750 elected officials who will be attending the convention and can pledge any candidate regardless of how their home state voted.Chris Bowers, a savvy Democratic strategists lays out the scenario:[Q]uick math shows that after Super Tuesday, only 1,428 pledged delegates will still be available. Now, here is where the problem shows up. According to current polling averages, the largest possible victory for either candidate on Super Tuesday will be Clinton 889 pledged delegates, to 799 pledged delegates for Obama. (In all likelihood, the winning margin will be lower than this, but using these numbers helps emphasize the seriousness of the situation.) As such, the largest possible pledged delegate margin Clinton can have after Super Tuesday is 937 to 862. (While it is possible Obama will lead in pledged delegates after Super Tuesday, it does not currently seem possible for Obama to have a larger lead than 75). That leaves Clinton 1,088 pledged delegates from clinching the nomination, with only 1,428 pledged delegates remaining. Thus, in order to win the nomination without the aid of super delegates, in her best-case scenario after Super Tuesday, Clinton would need to win 76.2% of all remaining pledged delegates. Given our proportional delegate system, there is simply no way that is going to happen unless Obama drops out.Clinton already has a large, unofficial lead in Superdelegates with at least 184 pledged to her candidacy already to Obama's 95. As the establishment candidate, Clinton can be expected to scoop up a large percentage of the remaining Supers - unless Obama can prove he would be a stronger candidate against McCain in the general election. In this case, both candidates poll within the margin of error against McCain so no advantage to either can be seen.A likely scenario would be the Clinton machine being able to rack up enough endorsements to put Hillary over the top within a couple of weeks of the last Democratic primary in June.\n    A shocking new poll out today from Decision Analyst shows Barack Obama leading Hillary Clinton by double digits in the race for the Texas primary:Barack Obama has a double digit lead over Hillary Clinton in Texas, according to a statewide survey of 678 registered voters planning to vote in the March 4 Democratic Primary. The survey was conducted February 20 and 21 by Decision Analyst, a major national survey research firm. Decision Analyst projections indicate that if the election were held today Obama would win 57% to 43% over Clinton. The survey's margin of error is 3 percentage points, plus or minus, at a 90% level of confidence. For the Republican Primary, Decision Analyst projections indicate a John McCain win over Mike Huckabee 59% to 35%, with Ron Paul at 6%. These results are based on interviews with 399 registered voters planning to vote in the March 4 Republican Primary in Texas. The survey's margin of error is 4 percentage points, plus or minus, at a 90% level of confidence. The size sample may be smaller than is optimum but the poll reflects Obama's growing strength nationally in making inroads into Hillary Clinton's support. It appears that Hillary's \"firewall\" in Texas and Ohio are myths and that Obama may be heading for another big night on March 4."

In a CBS News poll taken three weeks ago, shortly before Super Tuesday, Obama and Clinton were tied at 41 percent. Clinton led by 15 points nationally in January. The former first lady has lost her advantage among women, according to the poll: The two leading Democrats now have even levels of support among female primary voters. Men, meanwhile, disproportionately favor Obama. He leads Clinton among male Democratic primary voters 67 percent to 28 percent, and leads among white men 61 percent to 33 percent. There it is in a nutshell. Hillary is barely holding her own among women while she is getting slaughtered among male voters. With gender numbers like that, her support among Hispanics and even senior citizens becomes irrelevant. Meanwhile, a week before the Texas and Ohio primaries, the race is even in the Lone Star State: In the CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday, 50 percent of likely Democratic primary voters said Obama is their choice for the party's nominee, while 46 percent backed Clinton. But taking into account the poll's sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points for Democratic respondents, the race is a virtual tie. Clinton had a statistically insignificant 50 percent to 48 percent edge over Obama in last Monday's CNN/ORC poll in Texas. \\\"The 2-point gain for Obama and the 4-point drop for Clinton are both within the poll's sampling error, so although the survey appears to indicate some movement toward Obama, we cannot say for certain that he has gained any ground since last week,\\\" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. Two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically evenThe CBS-Times poll also shows 6 out of 10 Democrats believing that Obama has the best chance to beat John McCain next fall while a USA Today-Gallup poll show 7 out of 10 Democrats believing that Obama is the most electable.The Democratic party appears to have made up its mind. And unless some miraculous turnaround occurs, it appears that March 4 in Texas will indeed be Hillary Clinton's Alamo.\""
