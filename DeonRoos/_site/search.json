    "text": "Universities across the UK are in a pretty precarious position right now. After both Brexit and COVID the number of students has begun to fall. Especially the ever-attractive-to-senior-management-international-students-cause-£££.\nThe well may be drying up.\nAnd in some cases dramatically. Coventry University was a crazy £90 million in debt. Dundee was talking about having to fire ca. 600 employees because senior management weren’t too good at maths (-£40 million appeared over night!).\nNow, possibly in combination with inflation and the “cost-of-living-crisis”, the long term viability of some universities is looking… Grim. Grim dark.\nThis got me thinking over the weekend as to why. What’s going on with high-school students that makes it less attractive to go to uni. I can’t answer this. I’d need to do a survey of school kids and universities would never pay to get evidence to make a decision. Why waste money on research? You dumbass. Research is how they make money. They don’t pay for it.\nInstead I can look at some larger scale patterns. I think universities right now see a lot of this as being due to Brexit (and latterly, the Tories not being the most welcoming to foreigners) removing the European pool of applicants (thanks O’Brexit…).\nBut if that’s the case, then we shouldn’t see any similar kinds of trends in UK students, right? Their numbers should be relatively stable.\nSo that’s the idea. If UK students are relatively stable, while everything else collapses around them, then it’s probably Brexit. And strategies to target non-EU international students may well work. But if not? Well shit I guess.\n\n\nI’ll be skipping the data processing and going straight into the analysis. As such, I will only be using a few packages:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mgcv)\n\n# DT is just for including data in the blog\nlibrary(DT)"
